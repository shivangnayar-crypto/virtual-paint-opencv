# virtual-paint-opencv
This is a virtual paint program which is made by using opencv in c++.

There are two source codes, 1st code --> object_detection_1.cpp, this file contains the code for getting the specific color code for the color we need in the paint program (in HSV format). 2nd file --> virtual_paint.cpp, this file contains the code for the paint program, each line of code is described in the program itself by commenting the line in c++, You can easily understand the program by reading the comment lines.

This project was inspired from Ali Mortaza's project.

Thank you.
